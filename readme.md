# Reddit Bot - Deviant Art Mirror

Hello! I scan submissions from DeviantArt and mirror them on Imgur. This is useful for a few reasons:

* To get around work filters.
* To avoid having to load a slow-loading DeviantArt page (especially on mobile devices.)
* Well, that's about it I suppose.

If you have any question about me, you can check out the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeviantArtMirrorBot/comments/10cupp/faq/) or [send my creator a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Anaphase&subject=ATTN:%20DeviantArtMirrorBot).

If I've mirrored your artwork and you do not wish to have your art on Imgur, please [contact my creator immediately](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Anaphase&subject=ATTN:%20DeviantArtMirrorBot&message=Please remove%20my%20artwork%20from%20Imgur.) and he will remove it for you.
